# Advent of Code
This project strives to show python based solutions for all "Advent of Code" puzzles provided under the 
URL https://adventofcode.com/
It is a pure educational project so don't expect perfect code neither in performance, readability nor elegance.

## Get it running with PyCharm

1. Check out the code to the directory of your choice (e.g. ~/PycharmProjects)
2. Make a new project in PyCharm, named advent_of_code
3. PyCharm will ask you to create a new project on existing files. Thats fine.
4. PyCharm takes care of the runtime environment, so you should have a ignored .venv folder in the root of the project
5. Run a random script and check, if it works without any hassle.
